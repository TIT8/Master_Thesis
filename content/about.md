Hi 👋, I'm Lorenzo Perlo, a 25-year-old M.Sc. student in electronic engineering at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/en/) as of 2024.

This website is generated with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and was created as a companion to my [official master's thesis](https://www.overleaf.com/read/vnvqvmtqgnjc#6bc5a4) written in LaTeX. Since I find writing in Markdown easier, I think it will be simpler to include the "tips and tricks" section of my thesis here. This way, I can maintain a more rigorous structure in the LaTeX version, while using a friendlier style here to focus on the details of my learning process.

I'm nearing the end of my university journey, aiming to complete my master's degree in July 2025 🤞. My thesis will be conducted at [Allegro Microsystems](https://www.allegromicro.com/en/) in Prague, an international company specialized in current sensors, with a focus on analog design (see [Thesis progress]({{<ref "posts">}}) for more details). 

Since this is my first time living abroad 🌍, many posts here will also reflect my experiences learning the language and exploring the culture in the Czech Republic.

Feel free to comment on my posts or reaching me out via one of the links you find in the [home page]({{<ref "/">}}). So come on 💪 and thanks for reading 🥰.
