# Brief Presentation

Have you read the [about]({{<ref "/about.md">}}) page? If not, go there NOW 😤!

If yes, well... what can I say? I'm Italian, learning every day how to cook something better and better, a passionate book reader, swimmer, and an electronics enthusiast. Like many others, my journey started with Arduino when I was 14, and now here I am, writing in Markdown... what a happy ending, right?

But that’s not all. I love chemistry, physics, and biology, as well as classical music. This is why I chose to study electronics after high school, and university has since taken me further than I could have imagined.

# Why Electronics?

**Because it’s interdisciplinary. FULL STOP**❗

During my time at Politecnico di Milano, I encountered so many new things that I can hardly go back to thinking the way I did before. University made me feel older because now it’s difficult to say, “You don’t know how much I’d like to be a kid again.” There are many reasons for this:

- Because of photonics, with waveguides carrying signals so fast and so precisely;
- Because of electromagnetic waves, which exist in a field that permeates the universe — stars excite it, but do not create it;
- Because of glucose, fueling my brain for the sodium-potassium pump, enabling action potentials across my neurons;
- Because of circuits that enable you to read this;
- Because of sensors and measurement units that help me drive, support flights around the world, and assist in diagnosing and treating diseases;
- Because of the refrigerator, oven, washing machine, and other appliances that make my life easier and longer with their hygiene and food-preservation benefits.

And you, Lorenzo... do you really want to go back to being a child? **!?** You can still play with Gormiti or Pokémon whenever you like. So, I’m hesitant to go back because of the knowledge I’ve gained, it’s so fascinating; how could I give it up?

# The New Things 🏋️‍♂️

So here I am, driven by curiosity and writing on this website because I’m about to take a big step in my life: not just living alone (done ✔) but moving abroad, to the Czech Republic, stepping out of my comfort zone and into a new work environment.

Up until now, I’ve been a student for 90% of my life. And yes, university isn’t so different from school; it’s always a safe zone, though a bit less so. In the first year of my Master's, I tried to study and work simultaneously, but work completely overtook studying. That job was in my father’s small company, still, another safe zone.

Now I’ll be working for Allegro Microsystems in Prague, still in electronics, but closer to silicon (better aligned with my goals).

# What "Work" Means to Me 👷

This would have been a silly question 150 years ago, when science was still progressing at a slow pace. Back then, people worked directly for their survival — to have food, a warm home, and the basic essentials to stay alive with limited food and clean water.

Today, it's a much more interesting question: I go to the bathroom, and with a flush, my waste disappears; I want a yogurt, and the fridge has kept it fresh for me; I relax in front of the TV, and with a button press, it turns on; all of this happens in a few minutes, in a warm room. Food is always accessible; you just drive to get it. If you get sick, take a pill...

Life is incredibly easy, isn’t it? But this amazing system still requires people to keep it running.

**So for me, work is this: being part of this seemingly autonomous organization that sustains life and, when possible, makes it even easier.** 

Let the journey begin! 🗽
